# Specification Quality Checklist: Players Interface

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. The spec is ready for `/speckit-plan`.
- API endpoint paths (e.g., `POST /api/v1/players`) are referenced as the surface contract the feature interacts with, as explicitly specified in the user's feature description. These are existing endpoints that will be extended or consumed — not greenfield implementation choices.
- JSONB is referenced in FR-021 to document the existing backend data format that the frontend must interact with. This is a pre-existing constraint, not a design choice.
